# How Scrum as an agile methodology works

Scrum, is an agile methodology to work in teams. The main characteristic of scrum are its "sprints"

Sprint:

- Consists in delivery a certain amount of work in a determine period of time (1 - 4 weeks, 2 weeks is standard)

Sprint notes:

- Before every sprint begins, there is a meeting called "sprint planning" in which every team select the "to-dos" they will be working on along the sprint.

## Fundamental blocks

**ARTIFACTS:**

- Product backlog: list of everything that need to be done in order of finishing the whole project (like a to-do list of new features, requirements, improvements, fixes, etc.)
- Sprint backlog: are the "to-dos" selected to be implemented in a sprint (this "to-dos" can't be modified until the end of the sprint)
- Sprint goal: is the goal to achieve at the sprint's end, and it is set at the beginning of the sprint (E.G new module, new system version, etc.). It also serves as a way of working process measurement

**CEREMONIES (DAILY MEETING):**

- Grooming: backlog's review to assure the "to-dos" are still relevant and to establish new priorities
- Spring planning: the team plan every work that is going to be done during the sprint, the plan is based in the sprint goal and should be validated by every team's member (It helps to know if the to-dos are realistic and can be achieved)
- Sprint review: every team member does a quick demo of the results achieved during the sprint
- Sprint retrospective: team meets to discuss what stuff has worked and what hasn't during the sprint also what will be the solution to it

Daily meeting has the goal to achieve the answer to these questions:

- What did I do yesterday?
- What will I plan to do today?
- Is there any obstacle?

**USER STORIES:**

Are sentences that are made to understand a "to-do" in a more natural way (even no devs should be available of understanding them)

User stories should have a common structure:

- Template: > AS A ----- I WANT TO ---, SO THAT ----.

- E.G: AS A "FINAL USER" I WANT TO "SIGNUP IN THE SITE", SO THAT "I CAN ACCESS TO MY PROFILE"

**USER BOARD:**

Is a place where the user stories are placed to see the process of the "to-do" during the sprint

- E.G: TABLE'S STRUCTURE OF USER STORIES AND THEIR PROGRESS DURING THE SPRINT

| TO-DO | IN PROGRESS | RESOLVED | DONE |
